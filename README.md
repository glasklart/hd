Out-of-the-way transparent WinterBoard theme that lets you really
showcase your wallpaper. Glasklart is swedish, it means "clear as
glass".

Now includes **7900+** icons which have been graciously crafted by the community.

Since the release of Version 4.9.0 Glasklart is compatible to iOS7 and iOS8. Since version 4.24.0 we are using [`Anemone`](https://twitter.com/anemone_ios). [`IconBundles`](https://github.com/nickfrey/IconBundles) and by [@nickfrey](https://github.com/nickfrey) and the Winterboard-Plugin [`ThemeLib`](https://github.com/coolstar/themelib) by [@coolstar](https://github.com/coolstar) must be removed. Please add the repo `http://anemonetheming.com/nightly/` to Cydia and install `Anemone`.

Glasklart can be either downloaded from Cydia (search for 'Glasklart'), or you can [click

A Word About The Artwork
=====================================================================
This is, was ever and will be ever a completely free theme and nobody made or will ever make money with it. All icons here are created by hand, using the artwork from the original authors only as inspiration. So every Glasklart icon in the theme is it's own piece of art. We fully respect the creators of the original artwork. Glasklart is a very popular Winterboard theme and we have seen people that are uninstalling apps because they are not themed... so in the end we are helping to develop apps without of charge and completley for free.  
Pax tecum.
