Overview
=====================================================================

Out-of-the-way transparent WinterBoard theme that let's you really
showcase your wallpaper. Glasklart is swedish, it means "clear as
glass".

Now includes 6600+ icons! 120 I created on my own, the rest has been
graciously crafted by the community.  In addition to that: custom
badges, lock screen skin, popup dialogs, SMS bubbles, calculator skin,
dialer skin, call skin and a lot of separate options for additional
customization. 

This theme is for iPhone devices which are Retina-display compatible.
If you are looking for the non-Retina version, click here.

Either download from Cydia (search for Glasklart Classic), or
[click here](https://github.com/glasklart/classic/downloads).

Installation
=====================================================================

After you manually install or (preferrably) install via Cydia, you will
probably want to do the following:

  1. Connect to the filesystem (iFile, SSH, etc)
  2. Navigate to `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileIcons.framework/`
  3. Rename `AppIconMask.png` to `AppIconMask-backup.png`

This is optional, however if you choose not to do this, the icons will
show up against a black graphic.

Note: There is a side effect that this makes unchanged icons squared.
Unfortunately, at this time, this is the only solution.

Icon Requests
=====================================================================

Before _all_ icon requests, do the following:

Search to see if the icon has already been created.

  * Google for: `"your app's name" intitle:glasklart intitle:theme site:macthemes.net/forum`
  * Search the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/glasklart/hd/issues)

If the icon exists:

  * __Do not proceed any further__.

If the icon does not exist:
  
  * Create a new issue. Only 1 icon request per issue. __Issues with
    multiple icon requests will be closed.__

Rename Icon Request
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If the icon has already been created, but the spelling has changed,
enter an issue title with both names such as:

    "Runkeeper Free" renamed to "Runkeeper"

You will need to provide any information that has changed from the
current icon as it is in Glasklart such as the `Bundle ID` or
`PNG Icon Name` (see "New Icon Request" below).

### Example ###

To view an example renaming request with all the necessary information,
view issue [#1](https://github.com/glasklart/hd/issues/1).

New Icon Request
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If the icon has not already been requested, enter an issue title with
only the name of the application such as:

    Find My Friends

Do not enter

    Requesting Find Friends!!!!1!!
    ZOMG I would <3 you forEVAH if you did this one! :)
    I can't Find My Friends! Can you help!?!?!?
    URGENT!! YOU MUST DO THIS FOR ME OR I'LL DIE OF DYSENTERY!

### Tracking Down Needed Information ###

There are a few specific pieces of information we'll need in order for
the icon request to be valid.

__If you do not provide the exact information below, your request will
be rejected.__

  * `Name` _eg: RunKeeper_
  * `Bundle ID` _eg: RunKeeperPro_
  * `PNG Icon Name` _eg: IconPro@2x.png_
  * `Artwork URL` _eg: http://dioi4pcdjblhi.cloudfront.net/images/215cba7fab1a48a7bd511445c04c1193.jpg_

#### Find Icon Graphics ####

In order to find the source graphics for your icon, you may first want
to stop here: http://iextract.quadrat4.de

If you cannot find the graphics for your app, you will need to hunt
them down yourself and provide a link to the appropriate file.

The easiest way to provide us the image is to save the icon file to your
computer and use an app such as Dropbox or CloudApp to provide a public
URL to it.

#### Find the Bundle ID and Icon Name ####

Finally, you'll need to track down the Bundle ID and filename of the icon
as it exists within the application itself.

The easiest way to find it is to search here:

http://iphone.xengi.net/cfbundleidentifier

If it does not exist at the link above, you will need to track down that
information yourself and (if you're feeling generous) [add that information
to the database](http://ios.xengi.org/cfbundleidentifier/default/).

### Example ###

To view an example icon request with all the necessary information,
view issue [#2](https://github.com/glasklart/hd/issues/2).


Icon Contributions
=====================================================================

Glasklart is a community effort, we can only continue being this successful with
your help!

Responding to Icon Requests
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are responding to an icon request made by someone other than yourself, all
that is required is a comment on that request with links to all the necessary files.

These are most easily given using a system such as Dropbox or CloudApp.

__Only one icon should be attached per issue thread__ This helps us keep things
nice and organized.  If you submit more than one per thread, we'll still accept
them, but _please_ don't.  We're trying to keep things efficient now as well as
in the future.

Fulfilling Your Own Icon Requests
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are submitting an icon without a prior request, you should go up to the
section on "Icon Requests" and follow all of those steps.

The obvious exception is the `Artwork URL` which is not necessary since you will
be providing the Glasklart themed icon instead.

Templates

### Glasklart Icon Template ###

[Download the Icon Template](http://www.maxthemes.com/downloads/glasklart-template2.zip)

Please, please, read the README included with the template for information on how
to set up your device for theming and how to use Bundles.

### Glasklart GUI Templates ###

[Glasklart Dialer Template](http://www.maxthemes.com/downloads/glasklart-dialer.zip)
This allows you to make a transparent dialer with the background of your choice. This
should be relatively self explanatory for the average Photoshop user with knowledge of the
iPhone. Needless to say, it's not for everyone.
