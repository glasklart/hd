Out-of-the-way, transparent iPhone theme that lets you really
showcase your wallpaper. Glasklart is swedish, it means "clear
as glass".

Now includes **5.400+ high resolution** icons which have been graciously crafted by the community.

Glasklart is compatible to iOS7, iOS8 and iOS9. Since version 4.24.0 Glasklart uses [`Anemone`](https://twitter.com/anemone_ios). `IconBundles`, `ThemeLib` and `Winterboard` are not needed anymore.
To use Glasklart, please install `Anemone`.

Glasklart can be either downloaded from Cydia (search for 'Glasklart'), or you can [click

A Word About The Artwork
=====================================================================
This is, was ever and will be ever a completely free theme and nobody made or will ever make money with it. All icons here are created by hand, using the artwork from the original authors only as inspiration. So every Glasklart icon in the theme is it's own piece of art. We fully respect the creators of the original artwork. Glasklart is a very popular Winterboard theme and we have seen people that are uninstalling apps because they are not themed... so in the end we are helping to develop apps without of charge and completley for free.  
**Pax optima rerum.**
